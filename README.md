This is a second version of my CS50 Final Project, implemented with Gabriel Simoes.
I'm coding this in Django, to make the website more efficient and make maintenance easier in the future... (Django >>> PHP)


What needs to be done:
	- Improve the scores deletion: add an is_active attribute for soft delete.
	√ Update college's total scores after adding a match.
	√ deploy to heroku.
	√ Improve authentication system.
	- Display scores for each sport in every college's homepage.
	- Fix the datepicker widget.

I'll work on those and keep documenting stuff here...
