This is a second version of my CS50 Final Project, implemented with Gabriel Simoes.
I'm coding this in Django, to make the website more efficient and make maintenance easier in the future... (Django >>> PHP)


What needs to be done:
	 √ Improve the scores deletion: add an is_active attribute for soft delete. [obs: I wont use soft delete, I added an error message that will inform the user about the error. Django handles the delete by deleting in cascade all the objects related to a foreignkey that was deleted.]
	√ Update college's total scores after adding a match.
	√ deploy to heroku.
	√ Improve authentication system.
	√ Display scores for each sport in every college's homepage.
	- Fix the datepicker widget.
	- Who added scores.
	√ Better error for form input.
	- Sport names in colleges homepage.

I'll work on those and keep documenting stuff here...
