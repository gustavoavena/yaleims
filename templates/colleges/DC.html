    Davenport College was first completed in 1933, in a mainly Georgian style but with a gothic facade. Like many of Yale’s residential colleges, Davenport was designed by James Gamble Rogers. The college was named for John Davenport, who founded Yale’s home city of New Haven, Connecticut. An extensive renovation of the college’s buildings occurred during the 2004-2005 academic year as part of Yale’s comprehensive building renovation project. Separating the two main courtyards is the Crosspiece, a north-south component of the Davenport-Pierson complex which serves as the administrative heart of Davenport College, housing both the Dean’s and Master’s Offices and a classroom space as well as carrels and reading rooms extending from the college’s Spitzer Library. The Dining Hall features light broad-wood floors, ornately carved wooden wall details and a coffered, barrel-vaulted ceiling from which hangs Davenport’s piece de resistance, an elegant Waterford Crystal chandelier.
