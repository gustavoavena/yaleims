    Morse College is an eclectic structure built on an odd, angular site. In a modern attempt to capture the spirit of Gothic architecture, Saarinen eliminated all right angles from the living areas. One of Morse’s defining features is the “Lipstick,” a pop-art sculpture by Claes Oldenburg and brought to the college by Master Vincent Scully in the 1970’s. The Morse Common Room, once described by Scully as “an architectural disaster,” has improved with age. A new stereo, big screen TV, ping-pong table, air hockey table, pool table, and foosball make the Common Room an actively used space. Morse College Council meetings, held each Tuesday at 10:00 p.m., attract crowds with free pizza. Several enterprising Morsels run the college buttery, “The Morsel,” open for late night snacks and entertainment thrice a week.
