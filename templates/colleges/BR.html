    The words “Memorial Quadrangle” decorate the ceremonial Memorial Gate of Branford College, below the towering heights of the Harkness Tower. The building that is today divided between Branford College and Saybrook College was constructed between 1917 and 1922, as the Memorial Quadrangle. Mrs. Stephen V. Harkness donated the building to Yale University in memory of her son, Charles Harkness (Class of 1883), who died in 1916.Let’s say you were here in 1926, and walking down Elm Street, outside Durfee, you meet Clarence Mendell, Third Dean of Yale College and future master of Branford College. Having just made your acquaintance, he asks you where you live on campus. Looking across the street at the complex of buildings called the Berkeley Oval, and seeing out of the corner of your eye the Gym, Pool, Cage, Armory, Squash Courts, and Bowling Alleys, all standing where Trumbull College and Sterling Memorial Library now sit, you respond “Branford.” Dean Mendell gently corrects you, asking you if you mean to say that you live on the Branford Court in the Harkness Memorial Quadrangle, and informing you that Branford is a town up the road a bit where you almost certainly don’t live.
