    Trumbull College is located at 241 Elm Street in New Haven and is one of the smallest residential colleges at Yale. It is also by far the most picturesque, a granite fortress that looks just the way people think Yale is supposed to look, with Jacobean chimneys, gothic arches, and a Norman dining hall. On Elm Street between York Street and the Rose Walk, defined on the north by the wall of Sterling Libraryâ€™s most majestic fenestration, we find ourselves at the center of Yale, both physically and in spirit.
