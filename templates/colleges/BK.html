    Berkeley College is named in honor of the Reverend George Berkeley (1685-1753), Dean of Derry and later Bishop of Cloyne, who endowed Yale with a gift of land and books in the 18th century.  Berkeley presently occupies the site on which a group of buildings known as the Berkeley Oval stood from the 1890s until 1933, when construction of the college began with a gift of money from Edward S. Harkness.  It was completed in 1934. Our Coat of Arms, comprising “gules, a chevron, and ten crosses, paty silver,” is the crest of the Berkeley family.  Patterned on the drawing of architect James Gamble Rogers, a stone engraving of the coat of arms now hangs over the Elm Street Gate alongside the crests of the See of Derry and the See of Cloyne.  The arms of the Harkness and Seymour families appear just inside the gate.  (This brief history is adapted from The Residential Colleges at Yale University, 1967, Office of the Secretary).
